Key Points:

  4.1:
    ->  The Program Counter (PC) register contains the instructions
    ->  Reading one or two registers
    ->  Everything is done through the ALU (except for jump)
      ->  mux also plays an important role
    ->  for every instruction the PC is incremented by 4

  4.2:
    ->  Elements that operate on data values are combinational logic
      -> ALU
    ->  Other kind is state logic
      -> registers
      -> at least two inputs and one output
    ->  Different kinds of clocking methodology
      -> edge-triggered methodology
        ->  values updated only on the clock edge
    ->  control signals are used

  4.3:
    -> datapath elements
      ->  program counter (PC)
      ->  adder which increments the PC (used through ALU just adds 4)
      ->  must fetch instruction from the memory
    ->  R-type instructions are common
      -> take two registers, perform an operation and put result in another register
    ->  things stored in the register file

  4.4:
    ->  tell the ALU what instruction is it based on the 4 bit input
    ->  use a separate control unit to tell the ALU what to do



Confusing Things:

->  sign extend?
