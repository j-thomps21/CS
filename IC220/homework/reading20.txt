Key Points:

  -> Floating point allows binary to describe real numbers, not just integers
  -> Format:
    -> Sign bit, exponent bits, fraction bit
  ->  Double = double precision which doubles the amount of bits allocated to the number
  -> IEEE 74 is the floating point standard
  -> Its fairly simple to convert from floating point binary to decimal

Confusing:
  -> Floating point multiplication
