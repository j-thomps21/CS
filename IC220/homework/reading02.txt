Key Points:

-> most computer languages are quite similar
  -> this is because computers are built on similar principles
      -> Design Principle 1: Simplicity favors regularity
-> the compiler must break come complex statements down for the assembler to understand
      -> Design Principle 2: Smaller is faster
-> MIPS uses registers which are typically two character names. 32 of them
-> accessing in register is faster than in memory
-> machine language is base two (binary)
-> people have easier time writing in hex
      -> Design principle 3: Good design demands good compromise
          -> MIPS designers decided to make every instruction the same length
-> Logical operation classes
  -> shift
  -> AND
  -> OR
  -> NOT
  -> NOR
    -> the NOT of the OR function


Confusing:

-> load word?
-> r format?
-> r type?
