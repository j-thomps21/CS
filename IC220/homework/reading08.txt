Key Points:

-> The pseudocode that we write in QTSPIM is automatically translated to single line code
-> We can use system calls to print things to the screen such as strings or integers
-> We can also use system calls to read in things and write to files
-> exit terminates the program

Confusing:

->  what is the la command?
