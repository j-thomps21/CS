Key Points:

-> Parallel execution easier when the tasks are independent of each other
-> when tasks need to cooperate they need to be synchronized
  -> comes from some user declared routines and hardware level instructions
  -> lock and unlock synchronization
-> need hardware primitives
-> processor performance is tied to Moore's law (except it has ended for CPUs)
-> hard to make good processors thats easy to program for
  -> hard to take advantage of all the cores and put them to good use
