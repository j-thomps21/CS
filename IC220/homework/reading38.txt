Key Points:

-> Pipelining means multiple instructions overlapped in execution
-> things executed faster and more efficiently
-> Speed increase is equal to how many stages there are in the pipeline
-> MIPS designed for Pipelining
  ->  all instrucions are the same length
-> Hazards
  -> structural hazard = hardware cant support the combination of instructions that we want to execute
  -> Data hazard = pipeline needs to be stalled because one step must wait for another to complete
  -> Control hazard = needing to make a decision based on results of one instruction while otheres are executing
-> Pipelining shows potential for parallelism especially instruction level parallelism
  -> Increasing the depth of the pipeline to overlap more instruction
  -> replicate the internal components of the computer so it can launch multiple instrucitons every stage
