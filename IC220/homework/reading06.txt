Key points:

-> procedures us abstraction to make programming easier
  -> allows code to be reused
-> Six steps for procedures
  -> 1. procedure needs to access parameters
  -> 2. transfer control to the procedure
  -> 3. Acquire storage resources for the procedure
  -> 4. do the task
  -> 5. put the result in a place where procedure can access
  -> 6. return to the point of origin
-> use registers as much as possible
-> sometimes we need to use more registers than are allotted. This is where we go to the memory
-> Theres basically a register for everything
-> we use ASCII to represent text in computing
  -> each character is 1 byte
-> Three ways to process strings
  -> First position of the string gives the length of the string
  -> There is a variable that comes with the string that gives the length
  -> There is a character after the last character which is marked by NULL (marks the end)
-> Unicode uses 16 bits to represent each character. Lots of alphabets
-> Sometimes there is a need for large constants and addresses
-> Jump is simple
