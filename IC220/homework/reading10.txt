Key Points

-> Technology has grown at an insane rate
-> Silicon is the basis of technology
  -> Long complicated process
-> Time is the best measurement for performance
-> CPU performance vs instruction performance
-> benchmarking programs are used to measure performance
-> Fallacies
  -> Computers at low utilization use little power
  -> Designing for performance and designing for energy efficiency are unrelated goals
-> Pitfalls
  -> Expecting a performance increase in one area of the computer to result in overall performance increase of the computer
  -> Using a subset of the performance equation as a performance metric
-> Remember:
  -> Datapath
  -> control
  -> Memory
  -> Input
  -> Output
