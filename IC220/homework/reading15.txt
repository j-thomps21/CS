Key Points:
-> Constraint in clock system is that the signals must be valid
  -> If run long enough some logic will eventually return valid 
-> Memory elements include Flip-Flops and latches (simplest elements)
-> Lots of different ways to make logic gates
-> Can use register files for inputs into the mux

Parts that Confuse me:
-> How can a gate work when it takes in an output that hasnt been created yet?
