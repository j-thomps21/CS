Key Points:

Section 5.1:
  -> We create the illusion that we have unlimited memory
  -> Principles of locality
    -> Temporal Locality: If an item is referenced then it will likely be referenced again soon
    -> Spacial Locality: If an item is referenced then items around it are likely to be referenced
  -> Everything is in a memory hierarchy. More expensive, smaller, and faster to cheap, slow, and a lot
    -> SRAM (cache)
    -> DRAM
    -> SSD
    -> Large storage (HDD)
  -> Hit rate, hit time, miss rate, miss penalty

Section 5.3:
  ->  Cache is the highest level of memory

Section 5.5:
  -> We need dependability in our memory hierarchy
  -> Two Service states:
    -> 1. Service accomplishment
    -> 2. Service interruption
      -> Transition from state 1 to 2 is cause by error
      -> Transition from state 2 to 1 is caused by restoration
  -> Lots of different acronyms to describe failures and times for failures
  -> Ways to improve Mean time to repair
    ->  Fault avoidance
    ->  Fault tolerance
    ->  Fault forecasting
  ->
  ->


Confusing Parts:

-> Pretty much the entire cache section
-> Parity bits
