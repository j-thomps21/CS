Key Points:

  -> computers are pretty important
  -> Types: PCs, servers, embedded computers
  -> improving performance has a variety of meanings
    -> today best way to improve performance is to reduce power usage
  -> Moore's law
  -> Abstraction
  -> Common Case fast
  -> Parallelism
  -> Performance via pipeline
  -> Performance via prediction
  -> Hierarchy of memory
  -> Redundancy
  -> Operating system handles many key functions
    -> handles basic I/O operations
    -> allocates storage and memory
    -> shares multiple applications and can use simultaneously
  -> compilers translate code into something that the hardware can execute
  -> computing language is binary
  -> assembler translates symbolic notation into binary
  -> Big Picture: five classic components are
    -> input
    -> output
    -> memory
    -> data path
    -> control
  -> datapath controls arithmetic operations while control tells datapath, I/O, memory what to do based on instructions
  -> DRAM is basically RAM but takes same amount of time to access programs in any order
  -> Cache is a buffer for DRAM and is called SRAM (static RAM)
  -> silicon is the bread and butter of our society today
  -> processors are made through a meticulous process of turning silicon into wafers and removing impurities, also adding chemicals
  -> performance depends on the definition
  -> time is the measure of computer performance
  -> The speed increase of processors has slowed recently because of cooling.
    -> We need to focus on making processors that use less power (and therefore don't get as hot)
    -> Though the new CPUs use less power than before, they are still faster than previous generations though the speed increase is not as significant
  -> Less power is also very important for battery life for phones, tablets, and laptops
  -> Hardware has now added multicore microprocessors to increase throughput
  -> This forces programmers to rewrite code in order to fully utilize all the cores of the processors (optimize)
  -> Parallelism helps speed up the process
    -> difficult to do though

  Very interesting stuff
