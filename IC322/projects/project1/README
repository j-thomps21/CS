Using the program:

You must compile all of the given java files in order for the Router class to work.

How to compile: javac *.java
Run command: java Router

The Router class is what you will be running to get the desired output (none of the
other classes have main methods inside). Simply using the command "java Router" will
show you how to use the program. It takes two files, a Routing table file of a specific
format (I will include the Table 1: Routing Table which is in the required format), and
the input IP file that uses the binary IPs. Because the program takes in a routing table
file, it allows the program to be more versatile and simulate a router that has a different
routing table than the one that was specfied in the project page.

My program should work 100%
