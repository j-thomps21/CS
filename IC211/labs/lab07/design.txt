      Class Dot:

          -> dataFields
              ->  Char for color
              ->  Row number
              ->  Col number
              ->  Direction integer (1 = up, 2 = right, 3 = down, 4 = left)


          -> methods
              -> Simulate a round (move either row or col by one based on direction)
              -> random change to direction
              -> toString()
              -> Iter (probably)
              -> node
              -> Queue


      Class DotQueue:
          -> dataFields
              -> head, data

          -> methods
              -> enqueue
              -> dequeue? prolly not
